    "## 1. Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The New York Times Best Seller list is widely considered the preeminent list of best-selling books in the United States. It has been published weekly in The New York Times Book Review since October 12, 1931. In the 21st century, it has evolved into multiple lists, grouped by genre and format, including fiction and non-fiction, hardcover, paperback and electronic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rankings reflect unit sales reported on a confidential basis by vendors offering a wide range of general interest titles published in the United States. Every week, thousands of diverse selling locations report their actual sales on hundreds of thousands of individual titles. The panel of reporting retailers is comprehensive and reflects sales in tens of thousands of stores of all sizes and demographics across the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book selling universe is comprised of well-established vendors as well as emerging ones. The sales venues for print books include national, regional and local chains representing tens of thousands of storefronts; many hundreds of independent book retailers; scores of online and multimedia entertainment retailers; supermarkets, university, gift and big-box department stores; and newsstands.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the 1950s, the list was on its way to being the marketing behemoth it is today, curating a list of the country’s most popular books."

    "## 2. Data Description and Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "The New York Times best sellers are divided into different categories such as fiction, non-fiction, hardcover, paperback, electronic and so on. However, in this analysis we will consider the list of a hardcover fiction best sellers from June 7, 2008 to July 22, 2018 since this is the information given in dataset. Nevertheless, it provides a huge amount of information I am interested to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collected data consists of several points: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Book Title** - the distinguishing name of a book\n",
    "- **Author** - the composer of a literary work\n",
    "- **Date of the best seller list** - a particular day, month and year at which the best sellers list was created\n",
    "- **Published date of the list** - a particular day, month, and year at which the list was published\n",
    "- **Book description** - a statement that describes a certain book\n",
    "- **Rank (this week and last week)** - position in the list\n",
    "- **Publisher** - a person or company whose business is the publishing of books, periodicals and so on\n",
    "- **Number of weeks on the list** - the length of time a book was in the list\n",
    "- **Price** - the amount of money for which book is bought"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** What kind of books, genre, do many people prefer to buy the most?\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** How much does rank influence the popularity of a particular book around the world?\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** Is there a correlation between the date the book was released and its subsequent place in the rankings?\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** How accurate is the data provided by the source given the criticism it received?\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.** How long, on average, have books been at the top of this list for all time?"
